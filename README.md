Problem Definition:
Design and develop a To-Do List application that assists users in managing tasks, priorities, and deadlines effectively. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for creating, organizing, and tracking tasks across various categories, enabling users to enhance productivity and time management. Key features to include:

1. Task Creation: Users should be able to easily add new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.

2. Task Organization: Allow users to categorize tasks into different lists or categories (e.g., work, personal, shopping, etc.) for better organization and clarity.

3. Prioritization: Enable users to assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) to identify and focus on important tasks efficiently.

4. Deadline Management: Provide reminders and notifications for approaching deadlines to help users stay on track and meet their commitments.

5. Task Tracking: Allow users to mark tasks as completed, delete or edit tasks, and track progress on ongoing tasks.

6. Collaboration (Optional): Implement features for sharing tasks or lists with others, enabling collaboration on shared projects or activities.

7. User Customization: Offer customization options such as themes, layouts, and sorting preferences to tailor the application to individual user preferences.

8. Cross-Platform Accessibility: Ensure compatibility across multiple devices and platforms (e.g., web, mobile, desktop) to facilitate seamless access and synchronization of tasks.

9. Data Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data, including encryption, secure authentication, and regular backups.

10. Performance Optimization: Optimize application performance for smooth and responsive user experience, even with a large number of tasks and users.

The goal of the To-Do List application is to provide users with a centralized platform for managing their tasks efficiently, improving productivity, and reducing the risk of overlooking important deadlines or commitments.
